Project Overview
This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict heart disease based on a dataset of health metrics. The primary objectives are to preprocess the data, train various models, and evaluate their performance to determine the most effective method for prediction.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
Model Training: Implements several machine learning algorithms, including:
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forests
Gradient Boosting
Model Evaluation: Utilizes metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.
Visualization: Provides visualizations of data distributions, model performance, and feature importance.
Deployment: Includes guidance on deploying the trained model using a web application or API.
Data
The project uses the UCI Heart Disease Dataset, which includes features such as:

Age
Sex
Blood Pressure
Cholesterol Levels
Maximum Heart Rate Achieved
Presence of Chest Pain
The dataset is stored in data/heart_disease.csv.
